# Requirements and compatibility

## Requirements

Because the **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines,
please refer to each render pipeline's requirements documentation to see specific hardware and software requirements.
The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.


## Unity Render Pipeline compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines:
the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**,
and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**.
However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines.
Please refer to the [feature differences](FeatureModel_en.md) for each render pipeline for details.
